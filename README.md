# Music Style Translation based on CycleGAN

- Built a CycleGAN-based model to realize music style transfer between different musical domains.
- Added extra discriminators to regularize generators to achieve clear style transfer and preserve original melody, which made our model learn more high-level features.
- Trained several genre classifiers separately, and combined them with subjective judgement to have more convincing evaluations.

For details, refer to our paper [Symbolic Music Genre Transfer with CycleGAN](IEEE 2018 30th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI)). 

For some examples in paper, we uploaded them to our YouTube channel.

For the datasets, we uploaded them to our Google drive.

## Prerequisites
- tensorflow r1.1
- numpy 1.11.0
- scipy 0.17.0
- pillow 3.3.0

## Getting Started
### Installation
- Install tensorflow from https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xhujoy/CycleGAN-tensorflow
cd CycleGAN-tensorflow
```

### Train
- Download a dataset (e.g. zebra and horse images from ImageNet):
```bash
bash ./download_dataset.sh horse2zebra
```
- Train a model:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --dataset_dir=horse2zebra
```
- Use tensorboard to visualize the training details:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=./logs
```

### Test
- Finally, test the model:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --dataset_dir=horse2zebra --phase=test --which_direction=AtoB
```

## Training and Test Details
To train a model,  
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --dataset_dir=/path/to/data/ 
```
Models are saved to `./checkpoints/` (can be changed by passing `--checkpoint_dir=your_dir`).  

To test the model,
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --dataset_dir=/path/to/data/ --phase=test --which_direction=AtoB/BtoA
```

## Datasets
Download the datasets using the following script:
```bash
bash ./download_dataset.sh dataset_name
```
- `facades`: 400 images from the [CMP Facades dataset](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~tylecr1/facade/).
- `cityscapes`: 2975 images from the [Cityscapes training set](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/).
- `maps`: 1096 training images scraped from Google Maps.
- `horse2zebra`: 939 horse images and 1177 zebra images downloaded from [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) using keywords `wild horse` and `zebra`.
- `apple2orange`: 996 apple images and 1020 orange images downloaded from [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) using keywords `apple` and `navel orange`.
- `summer2winter_yosemite`: 1273 summer Yosemite images and 854 winter Yosemite images were downloaded using Flickr API. See more details in our paper.
- `monet2photo`, `vangogh2photo`, `ukiyoe2photo`, `cezanne2photo`: The art images were downloaded from [Wikiart](https://www.wikiart.org/). The real photos are downloaded from Flickr using combination of tags *landscape* and *landscapephotography*. The training set size of each class is Monet:1074, Cezanne:584, Van Gogh:401, Ukiyo-e:1433, Photographs:6853.
- `iphone2dslr_flower`: both classe of images were downlaoded from Flickr. The training set size of each class is iPhone:1813, DSLR:3316. See more details in our paper.
